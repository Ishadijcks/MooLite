**What part of the game does your Plugin relate to?**
Ex. Combat

**What should your feature do?**
Ex. When doing combat I want to track how many Jerry's I've slain

**What kind of input and output does your feature need?**
Ex. I want a button to start and stop the tracking, and it should show a number representing the amount of Jerry's destroyed.
